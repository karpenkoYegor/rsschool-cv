#### Briefly About Myself:
Improve myself constantly, studying something new. Keep moving forward always. Try to do all the work properly and to the end. My aim at work is to do more with less time. Donâ€™t like doing much manual work, trying to automate it maximally. While studying at
school, I began to study the game development engine Unity. Like algorithms. Quickly grasp new material, responsible, punctual,initiative and responsive.
