#### Briefly About Myself:

Improve myself constantly, studying something new. Keep moving forward always. Try to do all the work properly and to the end. My aim at work is to do more with less time. Don’t like doing much manual work, trying to automate it maximally. While studying at school, I began to study the game development engine Unity. Like algorithms. Quickly grasp new material, responsible, punctual,initiative and responsive.

#### Code example:
##### Unique In Order from Codewars: 
>Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.
##### Solution:
```
var uniqueInOrder=function(iterable){
    if(iterable.length === 0)
      return [];
    let result = [];
    result.push(iterable[0]);
    for(let i = 0; i<iterable.length; i++){
        if(result[result.length-1] !== iterable[i])
            result.push(iterable[i]);
    }
    return result;
}
